	<h1>A superhero or superheroine is a stock<br> character that possesses abilities beyond<br> those of ordinary people,
	who typically<br> uses his or her powers to help the world<br> become a better place, or is dedicated to<br> protecting the public,
	 and fighting crime.<br> Superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that<br> is centered on such characters,
	[1] especially<br>  in American comic books since the 1930s<br> (and later Hollywood films) as well as in Japanese<br> media
	including kamishibai, tokusatsu, manga,<br> anime, and video games since the 1930s.</h1>
